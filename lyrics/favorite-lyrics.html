<p>I think, my fears come true<br />
You feel, the same way too<br />
Im leaving<br />
Pack my bags<br />
And I'll<br />
See you later<br />
See you later<br />
<br />
Looks like I can't keep up<br />
And you're fresh out of luck<br />
You want fire where its wrong, out of sight
When race already won<br />
See you later<br />
See you later<br />
<br />
Now that I'm older, can't seem to fight this feeling<br />
Running in circles, feels like I can't compete with Its not<br />
Too late now<br />
Too late now<br />
<br />
Now that I'm older, can't seem to fight this feeling<br />
Running in circles, feels like I can't compete with <br />
Feels like I can't compete with<br />
